- For 'Delete Presentation' we utilised a Red Button to ensure more importance as it has more consequences than other operations following the 
UI principle of "Brighter means important"

- For the whole web app, we utilised the same font throughout, ensuring that confusion is kept at a minimum

- Used a harmonious colour scheme through the web application, creating a sense of cohesion throughout

- We utilised both explicit and pattern affordances throughout the web app, for example use of explicit affordance with the 'Log out' button on the 
navigation bar and uses of pattern affordances inside a presentation, symbols left to the presentation are used to both indicate uploading a thumbnail
and editing details about the presentation without explicitly telling so.

- we utilised grid alignment in the dashboard and presentation, this allows for consistent and clean designs throughout.

- for switching between slides in a presentation, we ensured slides are able to be switched with left and right arrows ensuring easier navigation in a presentation

- we highlighted the current slides in the slide deck with blue, this gave user a better indicator of the current slide
