We've attempted to make this web app more accessible by:

1 - Using a colour scheme mixture of grey, white, black and blue with majority of the text being on black on a grey background or white on blue/grey. This
approach allows for a high average colour-contrast score throughout - allowing users to easily read off the web app

2 - Including alt classes on various compontnets throughout such as the upload thumbnail or edit title components in the presentation, this allows screen readers to know 
the function of such buttons

3 - including aria classes on various components throughout the webapp such as the modals, this provides additional
information to people with assistive technologies

4 - Making most components responsive by using percentage based margins or padding, this allows technologies with differing screen sizes to have
a more functional experience
